Everyone deserves the right to vote. Too often, the barrier of transportation denies Americans this right. Durham Drives is a grassroots organization created by your community to drive voters to and from the polls, both on Election day (Nov. 8) and throughout Early Voting (Oct. 20- Nov. 3). 
We are proud to partner with Bull City Votes (https://www.bullcityvotes.org), a group of citizen-activists in Durham dedicated to improving accessibility, awareness, and turnout in our elections.

We are committed to making this a safe experience for all involved - please review our [COVID-19 Guidelines]({{< ref "/covid">}} "COVID-19 Guidelines")
